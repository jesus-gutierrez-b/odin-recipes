        <img src="images/xmas_cookies.jpeg">

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="one two">Soft cut out sugar cookie that I have used for years.
        I sprinkle with colored sugar before baking or you could
        also try icing them when cool.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="one">3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup margarine, softened</li>
            <li class="two">1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together, 
                    set aside. In a large bowl, cream together 
                    the margarine and sugar until light and 
                    fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then 
                    stir in the vanilla. Gradually blend in the 
                    sifted ingredients until fully absorbed. 
                    Cover dough, and chill for 2 hours.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p id="second">Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
                    Grease cookie sheets. On a clean floured 
                    surface, roll out small portions of chilled 
                    dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut out shapes 
                    using cookie cutters.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Bake 6 to 8 minutes in the preheated oven, or 
                    until edges are barely brown. Remove from 
                    cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.</p>
